# pseudorandomGenerators
Approximating pi value by using pseudorandom generators.
Approximation is based on a fact, that two random integers are coprime with probability of 6/(pi^2)
Knowing that we can chack how accurate random generator is by checking how well it approximated pi value.
I used two methods. First is Java randInt() function. i created the second function based on SHA-256 hash function.
